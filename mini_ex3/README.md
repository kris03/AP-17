MY CODING PROCESS

I was quite happy with the idea of having to make a throbber. Something in motion, animation like.
The example from the class was very well explained and I tried it and found it fairly easy to code, based on the good example. 
Therefore I decided to do something else, I liked the idea to get the throbber to move along the x axis, rather than in a radius.

But I am not quite satisfied with the look on my final Throbber since I must admit that I overestimated how much time I would have to code during this week ..
I will definitely try better next week.

But having said that, I learned a lot of this mini exercise. I had much difficulty in understanding the use of PI in relation to to draw semicircles.
Fortunately I got some help from our instructor and  after a lot of youtube videos, I came closer to an understanding of how it is used.

USE OF PROGRAMMING TO RECLECT AND INQUIRE DIGITAL CULTURE

Today, we are all part of a digital culture where especially the younger generations do not know a life without digital artifacts and these are therefore quite a natural part of everyday life.
But despite that we live with and are part dependent on digital artifacts, so there are very few (including my self) who have an understanding of what happens when a program is running and how it really works. We do not understand computer language. For me to see are graphic icons and illustrations a way for programmers to simplify and translate a program's possibilities and limitations of the user.

I have always appreciated the ease of use and been excited for a simple and easy design when it came to my digital devices. But since I started this course, I have begun to consider what opportunities it would create if more people understood the underlying in software and thus even be able to participate in the development and coding, rather than that it is hidden behind user-friendly translations.
