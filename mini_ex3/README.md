MY CODING PROCESS
I was quite happy with the idea of having to make a throbber. Something in motion, animation like.
The example from the class was very well explained and I tried it and found it fairly easy to code, based on the good example. 
Therefore I decided to do something else, I liked the idea to get the throbber to move along the x axis, rather than in a radius.

But I am not quite satisfied with the look on my final Throbber since I must admit that I overestimated how much time I would have to code during this week ..
I will definitely try better next week.

But having said that, I learned a lot of this mini exercise. I had much difficulty in understanding the use of PI in relation to to draw semicircles.
Fortunately I got some help from our instructor and  after a lot of youtube videos, I came closer to an understanding of how it is used.
