- My coding challenge:
I chose The challenge with mandelbrot set. I was very fascinated by the sense of infinity as this fractal contains.

- Function / syntax added
I moved a little on the sliders, but it has been a great challenge for me to understand the math behind this exercise ..and I ran out of time - the plan was that I would have animated the mandelbrot set or perhaps tried to square z with more than 2, to change the mandelbrot's appearance. 
The hardest part has been that most references I could find about it online, was in other languages, among others c ++, which I'm not familiar with and therefore I found it difficult to translate into javascript. 
But it is something I will continue working on and hopefully succeed someday.

- Using a flowchart
I think flowcharts is a good way to structure the complex codes, both for ourselves and for others. For me is has also provided a greater understanding of loops and  for loops. 
It's a good way to visualize what for many is hard to understand.
