#Mini exercise 4

For this miniex, I had in mind to make something that somehow could express my opinion about something that I find particularly important and thus make a small program with a greater seriousness than the ones I've made so far. 

Xenophobia and racism scares me and it worries me that many people choose to meet other people with fear, hatred and prejudice rather than an inquisitive and open mind.

This I have tried to express in my program, in relation to refugees.

In order to 'start' click the mouse on the text, then you can use the arrow keys to the right and left.

In my workingprocess I have focused on trying a lot of separate functions and along the way I decided to use some that I thought fit my idea. Additionally, I had in mind that a feedback loop for me it is, that based on a given input is generated an output. 
Thus my program should be able to "react".
