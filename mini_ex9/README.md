- My chosen API

I have used Giphys API. I have chosen this, after trying with several other different all ended with one error after another. 
Giphy could both provide visual fun expressions and served. The program should work without the need to download anything. 
It shows the 25 most trending gifs at the moment.

- My process, using and representing data

This exercise has been the hardest for me so far. The challenge has not been to find the data I think would be interesting to work with - it 
surprised me how much data that was actually available.
For me the challenge was to use all this data in a meanningful way and get it to work both in terms of coding, but especially in the browser.
Although I am not happy with my final program (because I think it's a little uninteresting, compared to some of my other ideas), 
I have learned a lot from this exercise.

- My reflections on the aesthetics of (big) data

For me, there are many aspects when talking about aesthetics within large data
(which is not something I've ever thought about before this semester).
One of the things I particularly think about is that, when you work with such large amounts of information
it is very important to organize, structure and sort it in a meningsful way for both user and company.
Here I think visualization is an important and a great tool!
But I also believe that there should be more focus on the transparency of data.
Of course, you have to limit transparency both for business reasons and of course also for ease of use, 
but I've also become aware of how many possibilities there are in the use of data and that's why 
I among other reasons think it would be interesting to work with transparency.
