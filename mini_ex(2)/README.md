MY CODING PROCESS AND REFLECTIONS

This week our assignment was to design a cartoon character/graphic that expresses noises/glitches/errors. 
Because this is my first experience with programming I must admit my coding process in this exercise has been characterized most of my desire to explore the p5.js program and its possibilities rather than creating a solid design of an error/noise/glitch. 

My goal was to gain a greater understanding of the basics of the program and primarily how to work with the the coordinates, which is why I chose to portray an error message. Later on I tried a lot of different codes from the p5 references and tried to gain an understanding of how the various codes and values interacted. 

In my interpretation of the exercise the error is present when the mouse is clicked and another error message appears on the screen rather than disappearing. This to me is an example of an error - when a task can not be solved as expected.
An error occurs then, when a problem can not be solved with the expected actions and that means to me, that mistakes therefore can be the root of development and/or improvement. When we fail, we have to sit back and think creatively and constructively in a way to overcome the error.

As an example of the above I have repeatedly failed in getting mouseClicked() function to work. After many attempts it finaly worked, which must be seen as a development of my skills in p5.js.


WHAT CONSTITUTES A PROGRAM?

For me a program something that is able to perform a given task. 
This means that a program is carried by being able to convert a command to an execution of an action.
